My favorite part about programming is algorithm and data structures. I believe the core of those is Mathematics. That's why I decided to study Bachelor of Mathematics at University of Waterloo. My major is Combinatorics and Optimization which I believe will enhance my programming ability. Additionally, I also minor in Computer Science and self-learning in my free time to improve my coding skills. My goal is to become a back-end developer in Artifical Intelligence field where I can have fun with algorithm and data structures. </p>
